JAN. 13 (credit: Jos Vromans)
Self portrait. For example, get started with a very basic human face, a few circles or oval shapes. How far can you improve this by adding features that actually look like you. Try adding eyes, eyelashes, hair, and make a few parameters or colors variable. Even though you are aiming for a self portrait, it might be fun to render some random variations as well.

No libraries, no canvas, only HTML elements.

If you want to cheat and say that <canvas> or <svg> or even <img> are perfectly fine HTML elements, just remember that nobody ever hears the Genuary Police. I mean, has heard about the Genuary Police. It’s not true and there’s no such thing, stop asking. Anyhow, I don’t know have you heard about <div>’s? I heard they are pretty cool. Good luck!
